# Functions

Hey, you're probably looking to learn programming.
That's great. This is the first lesson or assignment or example, it's a combination of all of those things.
If you are completely new, checkout lesson 0. 
Lesson 0 goes over the absolute basics, it usually ends with strings, conditionals and loops. If you're unsure, take a quick look.

Alright: Lesson 1 will teach you to implement a class for polynominal functions (x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 3). 
You should be able to implement a class (or more) with the necessary fields to describe them, aswell as some methods to add, substract, multiply or derivate.

If you think your implementation runs fine, run the tests!
